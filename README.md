# Interactive-MNIST-app
This is an interactive MNIST app where user can draw a digit and the program will make a prediction using a CNN trained on MNIST.

Requirements are:
numpy,
matplotlib,
scipy, 
opencv,
tensorflow

To run the app just run GUI.py.

## Features

Currently the app is able to make a prediction, show what the input looks like and show top 3 predictions. 
The app is not sensitive neither to the position nor to the size of a digit. It always isolotes the digit first and prepare to be in a similar format to the ones in the training set.

Note: The goal of this app is not the design so there has not been much attention to that.
